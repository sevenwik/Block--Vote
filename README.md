# Block-vote
Indian elections vote percentage clocks only around **60-70 percent** most of the times. Our focus is to hit the **ton mark** with the help of **Azure Blockchain** which automatically manages the backend part and security thus allowing our developers to come up with the astonishing game changing app with a very *minimum fuss* and *great quality*.

## Why Blockchain ?

-  Double spending. 
-  Maintainy consistency is a cause of concern with the distributed systems, so there was a need to switch systems and move on to decentralized system.
- Resolving conflicts got easier in decentralized system with the emergence of hash functions.
- Servers are updated with better network connectivity, And with utmost security.

## Using Blockchain we can build :-

- Completely decentralized voting system.
- Each citizen can vote from anywhere in the world.
- No supervision needed.
- Each persons vote will be validated with his credentials, just like how a transaction is validated when it is placed in the a particular block.
- Each block can contain no. of voted depending upon total no of votes.
- With the help of this we can maintain consistency and also save a lot of time and the election process will be happen automatically without any supervision but with full transperancy, no separate commission needed expect for a pack of data miners.

The second obstacle in the voting is that most of the citizens are not **properly educated** of the parties and its promises made. So a complete back up of the promises and the candidates can be maintained using **azure cloud** too.

And since all of the process is made public and transparent, it adds to the tagline of 

> "By the people ,for the people." 

Thus reducing the risk of errors in counting too.

>"Bad officials are elected by good citizens who don't vote."

And our motto is *building a civilized nation* lead by skillful leaders so we came up with an idea which lets **everyone vote** irrespective of their race, wealth or mobility to the centre. Thus upholding **Unity In Diversity**.
